1. No Hacking The Game!
2. You objective is to get your number to 21 or close to 21.
3. Which ever player is closest to 21, without going over, wins!
4. If you go over 21 you automatically lose :(
6. Once you get your cards you will type HIT or STAY
  -Hit means get another card.
  -Stay means you do not want another card you want to see what the dealer has.
